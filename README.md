# CodeGist

This repo consists of python codes for automating some of the manual tasks.

1. # places.py
Python Code for interacting with Google Places API and Google Geocode API to find the details and reviews the nearby logding places near a given area.
The extracted information is then packed into a list of dictionary with various attributes.
This information can be used to automate the process of getting contact information of lodging places and calling them one by one to figure out the best place, instead of looking places one by one by clicking on serveral links and manually noting down the address and phone numbers. So, programming does make day-to-day life things easy. eh?

2. # send_mail.py

Python code for extracting data from CSV File (including email id) and using that data to send Emails to different people based on a attribute. It uses smtplib and gmail server for sending the email. 
For example, sending accepted/rejected emails to students. These emails will be personalised and save a lot of sender's time to send email one by one. Very  neat!
