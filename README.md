Python Code for interacting with Google Places API and Google Geocode API to find the details and reviews the nearby logding places near a given area.
The extracted information is then packed into a list of dictionary with various attributes.
This information can be used to automate the process of getting contact information of lodging places and calling them one by one to figure out the best place, instead of looking places one by one by clicking on serveral links and manually noting down the address and phone numbers. So, programming does make day-to-day life things easy. eh?
